It seemed Nicolas’ experimentations had come to affect Kopek, Levi, and Cornelius directly as they found themselves transported to a dark void after touching some arcane stone in the hexagonal tower. The blackness was kept at bay by light escaping an open doorway before them. With seemingly no choice but to enter, the party stepped forward, entering an extravagant room. The floor, walls, ceiling, and great columns were all constructed of gold, trimmed with lavender. Of a similar lavender color lay a great pond in the room’s center, spanned by a golden bridge, which itself led to a golden throne.

Occupying this golden throne was a singing human man, dressed in flamboyant robes befitting his even more flamboyant face, crowned by a solid and unmoving mass of hair. Flanking him were two figures, one a very old armored dwarf, and the other a tabaxi with a grandiose golden mane. The man immediately launched into a monologue detailing his obsession with Levi, to the gnome’s horror. The dwarf described the death of his wife, blaming businessmen like Cornelius, and the tabaxi delved into his distaste for hobgoblins, who once ruined an absolute rager he threw. The opposing trios decided that a beer pong match was in order, the winner of which would get to take Levi with them. As the match began, Levi took his fate into his own hands, and snuck beneath the pong table. He withdrew from his backpack the arcane cylinder, still dirtied by fluid number four from Cornelius, and sacrificed to it a drop of blood, activating it. 

As the beer pong match intensified, it was suddenly cut short. From beneath the table came an arcane eruption, ending the competition, and the lives of the enemy trio. As their foes perished, Kopek, Levi, and Cornelius exited the arcane anomaly and returned to the hexagonal tower, where they discovered the door had returned, freeing them from a potential purgatory.
